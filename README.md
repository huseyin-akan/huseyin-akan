## 🧠 About Me

I’m a **full-stack software developer** focused on building **robust, maintainable, and competitive systems**.

I care deeply about:
- clean boundaries
- predictable behavior
- codebases that don’t rot over time

I’m currently building **Challengle** 🎮 —  
a **competitive, fun-first challenge game** designed for **enjoyment, rivalry, and engagement**, not traditional learning platforms.
